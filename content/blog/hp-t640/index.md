## Consumption

One of the standout features of the HP T640 is its low power consumption. With a TDP capped at around **15W**, this device is highly energy-efficient while maintaining solid performance. Its passive cooling design eliminates the need for fans, making it silent during operation—perfect for environments where noise reduction is critical.

- With running Ubuntu Server 24.04 in idle we get about **3W** usage.
- Under low load Proxmox with some LXCs and a VM maybe around **4-6W**

## Performance

The AMD Ryzen R1505G CPU with Vega 3 Graphics delivers significantly better performance compared to typical ARM-based devices like the Raspberry Pi. Key performance highlights include:

- **CPU Performance**:
   - The Ryzen R1505G outperforms processors like the Intel Celeron J4105 or Pentium Silver J5005 commonly found in other mini PCs.
   - It offers ample power for multitasking, light productivity tasks, and media playback.
- **GPU Performance**:
   - The integrated Vega 3 GPU supports hardware transcoding and can handle console emulators smoothly.
   - It enables multi-monitor setups with up to three displays at **4K @60Hz**, making it ideal for productivity or digital signage applications.

When compared to competitors like the Dell Wyse 5070 or Fujitsu Futro S740, the HP T640 excels in several areas:
- Support for up to **64GB of RAM**, compared to just **30GB on the Wyse** and **16GB on the Futro S740**.
- A more powerful integrated GPU for graphics-intensive tasks.
- Flexible m.2 NVMe SSD support across multiple sizes (2230, 2242, and 2280).

## Use cases

- RaspberryPi alternative for hosting different kind of services
- MediaServer with Jellyfin / Plex combined with *arr Stack (Transcoding works great)
- Small emulator up to PS2

## Side Notes

The HP T640 also shines as a Raspberry Pi alternative due to its superior expandability and performance:

- Expandable RAM up to **64GB**, compared to the fixed memory on Raspberry Pi boards.
- A much more powerful CPU that can handle complex workloads.
- Built-in m.2 slots for NVMe storage and WiFi/Bluetooth modules.
- A wider range of ports and connectivity options.
- Comes with a robust case and power supply included.

While it lacks pre-installed storage or an operating system, this provides flexibility for users to customize their setup according to specific needs. Whether you're building a home server, media center, or lightweight desktop replacement, the HP T640 Thin Client Mini PC offers incredible value in a compact package.

### How to update BIOS

- FAT32 formatted stick
- The name of the USB stick must be `HP_TOOLS`
- Extract sp152017.exe (with Windows or probably works with 7zip)
- Copy the `toolless` directory into root of the stick
- Hint: Virtualization should be deactivated for BIOS upgrade
