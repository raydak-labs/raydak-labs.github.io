In the world of media server management, keeping your configurations up-to-date and consistent can be a challenging task. Today, we're excited to introduce Configarr, a powerful tool designed to simplify this process for Sonarr and Radarr users.

This is a community project driven by single individuals or groups of community members.

## What is Configarr?

Configarr is an open-source configuration and synchronization tool specifically created for Sonarr and Radarr, two popular media management applications. It aims to streamline the process of maintaining and updating configurations, custom formats, and quality profiles across your media server setup[8].

## Key Features

Configarr offers a range of features that make it stand out:

1. **TRaSH Guides Integration**: Easily sync custom formats and settings from the popular TRaSH Guides directly into your Sonarr and Radarr instances[8].

2. **Custom Format Support**: In addition to TRaSH Guides, Configarr allows you to include your own defined custom formats, giving you more flexibility in managing your media library[8].

3. **Multiple Configuration Sources**: Configarr supports syncing from TRaSH Guides, local files, and configurations defined directly in the tool's config file[8].

4. **Flexible Deployment Options**: Run Configarr using Docker, docker-compose, or even as a Kubernetes CronJob for regular synchronization[8].

5. **Compatibility**: Currently supports Sonarr v4 and Radarr v4, ensuring you're working with the latest versions of these applications[8].

## Why Use Configarr?

Managing media servers can be time-consuming, especially when it comes to keeping up with best practices and optimal configurations. Configarr addresses this by:

- **Automating Updates**: Stay current with the latest recommended settings from TRaSH Guides without manual intervention.
- **Enhancing Consistency**: Ensure all your instances are configured identically, reducing discrepancies and potential issues.
- **Saving Time**: Spend less time on configuration management and more time enjoying your media library.

## Getting Started

To start using Configarr, you'll need a few things:

1. A `config.yml` file to define your synchronization settings.
2. A `secrets.yml` file for storing sensitive information like API keys.
3. Optionally, custom format definitions in local files or within your config.

For a detailed setup guide and examples, visit the [Configarr GitHub repository](https://github.com/raydak-labs/configarr).

## Community and Contributions

Configarr is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're interested in adding new features, improving documentation, or reporting bugs, your input is valuable in making Configarr even better.

## Conclusion

Configarr represents a significant step forward in simplifying media server management. By bridging the gap between Sonarr, Radarr, and community-driven configuration guides, it offers a streamlined solution for maintaining optimal settings. Give Configarr a try and experience the benefits of automated configuration management for your media server setup.
